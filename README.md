# Personal_Finance_Analysis



Data Acquisition:
First, I downloaded my transaction data from my bank server as PDFs. Then, I turned them into CSV files using Excel.

Data Processing and Transformation:
Next, I explored the data in Python. I found a column labeled 'Description' that had important info about who received my money. Using this column, I organized my expenses into different categories and subcategories. After that, I made separate CSV files for things like rent and food expenses.


Visualization:
Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards.  This helped me spot trends, make smart choices, and understand my spending habits better.
